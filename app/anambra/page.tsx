                History
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Anambra is a state of rich history and great myths. Created on
                August 27, 1991, by the then Military President Ibrahim
                Babangida GCFR, the state derives its name from Anambra River,
                which is a colonial convenient pronunciation of Omambala River.
                The River Anambra is a tributary of the majestic River Niger.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The diverse perspectives to the origin of Anambra and Ndi
                Anambra are as mythical as the great people. Ndi Anambra are
                among the first set of God's creation on Earth, who migrated
                from the cradle of human civilization to their present location.
                Their history is strongly linked to the history of the entire
                Igboland, as Ndi Anambra are perceived as the source of Igbo
                Civilization.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Archaeological findings confirm their existence dates as far
                back as 4500BC, with evidence unearthed in various locations in
                the state, including Igbo Ukwu, Aguleri, Awka, Ezira and Nri.
