The Igbo language is the mother tongue, but English is widely spoken due to the early influence of Missionary Schools & The Royal Niger Company Traders. A vast majority speak pidgin, a mix of native Igbo dialect and the confluencing English Language, which was probably for ease of trade with visiting Europeans.`,

They also integrate easily with the host communities where they find themselves. As a fallout of their friendliness and large-hearted nature, Ndi Anambra have very high regard for and are openly generous to strangers. Indeed, the people are willing to go to great lengths to shower their well-known traditional hospitality on the visitors and strangers. Ndi Anambra are a people of uncommon species, shaped by history and environment to be tough, hardworking, creative, innovative and adventurous.`,

The great 'Zik of Africa', Rt. Hon. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, who played a key role in the emancipation of Africa and who is one of the founders of modern Nigeria; Sir Louis Philippe Odumegwu-Ojukwu, one of Africa's earliest millionaires; Chief Mrs Margaret Ekpo (Margaret Obiasulor), Nigeria's pioneer female politician, activist and leader; Professor Chinua Achebe, novelist, poet, professor and critic, whose first novel, "Things Fall Apart", is considered the most widely read book in modern African Literature. The never-ending list includes the First African Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku; fiery pre and post-independence politicians like Chief Mbazulike Amaechi and Chief Mokwugo Okoye; and the First Vice President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr Alex Ekwueme, to mention but a few.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Anambra is a state of rich history and great myths. Created on
                August 27, 1991, by the then Military President Ibrahim
                Babangida GCFR, the state derives its name from Anambra River,
                which is a colonial convenient pronunciation of Omambala River.
                The River Anambra is a tributary of the majestic River Niger.

                The diverse perspectives to the origin of Anambra and Ndi
                Anambra are as mythical as the great people. Ndi Anambra are
                among the first set of God's creation on Earth, who migrated
                from the cradle of human civilization to their present location.
                Their history is strongly linked to the history of the entire
                Igboland, as Ndi Anambra are perceived as the source of Igbo
                Civilization.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Archaeological findings confirm their existence dates as far
                back as 4500BC, with evidence unearthed in various locations in
                the state, including Igbo Ukwu, Aguleri, Awka, Ezira and Nri.
